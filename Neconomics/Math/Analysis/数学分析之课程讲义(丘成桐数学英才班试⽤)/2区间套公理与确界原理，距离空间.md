## Fundamental Properties of the Real Numbers

Assume $\mathbb{R}$ is a set equipped with $\leq$ and operations $+, \cdot$ such that $(\mathbb{R}, +, \cdot, \leq)$ satisfies the axioms (F), (O), (A), (I). Beyond what has been proven in earlier exercises, many “familiar” properties of real numbers must be rigorously derived from these axioms. Below we present a selection of such properties in exercise form. The full proofs are left for students as part of their own formalization.

### Exercises: Elementary Properties

1. Show:
    
    - $\leq$ and $+$ together imply: if $x \leq y$, then $x + z \leq y + z$
        
    - $\cdot$ and $\leq$ together imply: if $x, y \geq 0$, then $xy \geq 0$
        
2. Every finite non-empty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has a unique maximum and minimum element (assume elements are distinct). In particular, finite subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ can be ordered.
    
3. Let $x_i, y_i \in \mathbb{R}$ and $x_i \leq y_i$ for $i = 1, \dots, n$. Then:
    
    ∑i=1nxi≤∑i=1nyi\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \leq \sum_{i=1}^n y_ii=1∑n​xi​≤i=1∑n​yi​
    
    Equality holds iff $x_i = y_i$ for all $i$. In particular, if all $x_i \geq 0$, then $\sum x_i \geq 0$, with equality iff each $x_i = 0$.

### Lemma 3: Existence of Arbitrarily Large and Small Positives

For every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\frac{1}{n} < \varepsilon$;  
For every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that $0 < \delta < \varepsilon$.

> _Proof sketch_: Choose $n$ such that $n \cdot \frac{1}{n} = 1 < \varepsilon^{-1}$ using the Archimedean property. Then $\frac{1}{n} < \varepsilon$.

### Definition: Absolute Value

Define $|x|$ for $x \in \mathbb{R}$ as:

- $|x| := x$ if $x \geq 0$
    
- $|x| := -x$ if $x < 0$
    

---

### Exercises: Properties of Absolute Value

Let $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$

1. Show: $|x| \geq 0$ and $|x| = 0$ iff $x = 0$
    
2. Prove:
    
    −∣x∣≤x≤∣x∣-|x| \leq x \leq |x|−∣x∣≤x≤∣x∣
    
    In particular, $|x| \geq x$ and $|x| \geq -x$
    

> _Proof hint_: If $x \geq 0$, then $|x| = x$, and inequalities are trivial. If $x < 0$, then $|x| = -x$, and again the inequalities hold.

---

### Geometric Viewpoint of $\mathbb{R}$

We imagine $\mathbb{R}$ as a line:

- Each real number corresponds to a point
    
- Order corresponds to left-right positions
    
- Intervals represent line segments
    

While helpful in intuition, these geometric interpretations must be justified rigorously through the axioms and formal reasoning.

### Least Upper Bound Property (Supremum Axiom)

Let $A \subset \mathbb{R}$.

- If $\forall a \in A$, $a \leq M$, then $M$ is an upper bound of $A$.
    
- If $\forall a \in A$, $a \geq m$, then $m$ is a lower bound of $A$.
    
- $A$ is bounded if it has both upper and lower bounds.
    
- Boundedness $\iff$ $\exists B > 0$ such that $\forall a \in A$, $|a| \leq B$.
    

---

### Theorem 5 (Supremum Principle)

Let $A \subset \mathbb{R}$ be nonempty and bounded above.  
Let $M = {x \in \mathbb{R} \mid \forall a \in A,\ a \leq x}$ be the set of all upper bounds.  
Then $M$ has a least element, called the **supremum** of $A$, denoted $\sup A$.

---

### Proof Sketch (Supremum Principle)

Let $M_0$ be any upper bound. Fix a sequence of closed intervals $I_n = [a_n, b_n]$ such that:

- $a_n$ is not an upper bound of $A$
    
- $b_n$ is an upper bound
    
- $I_{n+1} \subseteq I_n$
    

This defines a nested sequence of intervals whose lengths $\to 0$.

Using the interval nesting axiom:

⋂n=1∞In={s}\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty I_n = \{s\}n=1⋂∞​In​={s}

is a singleton set.

Then:

- $s$ is an upper bound of $A$
    
- If $s' < s$, then $s'$ is not an upper bound (by construction)
    
- Therefore $s = \sup A$

### Notes on Supremum and Infimum

1. **Infimum (Dual Statement)**:  
    If $A \subset \mathbb{R}$ is nonempty and bounded below, then $\inf A$ exists and is the greatest lower bound.
    
2. Always: $\inf A \leq \sup A$
    
3. **Characterization**:  
    Let $s$ be an upper bound of $A$. Then:
    
    - $s = \sup A \iff \forall \varepsilon > 0,\ \exists a \in A$ such that $s - \varepsilon < a$
        
4. If the supremum principle holds, then the interval nesting axiom (I) can be derived from (F), (O), (A), and the supremum axiom.

## Concept of a Space

A **space** is a set equipped with additional structure.

### Definition 6: Metric Space

Let $X$ be a set. A function $d: X \times X \to \mathbb{R}$ is a **metric** if:

a) $d(x, y) \geq 0$ and $= 0$ iff $x = y$  
b) $d(x, y) = d(y, x)$  
c) (Triangle inequality) $d(x, z) \leq d(x, y) + d(y, z)$

Then $(X, d)$ is called a **metric space**.

> Intuitively, $d(x, y)$ measures distance between points (like in the Euclidean plane).

---

### Examples and Remarks

1. The definition of a metric space uses the real numbers.
    
2. Let $X = \mathbb{R}$ and define $d(x, y) = |x - y|$. Then $(\mathbb{R}, d)$ is a metric space.
    
3. Define:
    
    X=Rn,d(x,y)=∑i=1n(xi−yi)2X = \mathbb{R}^n,\quad d(x, y) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - y_i)^2}X=Rn,d(x,y)=i=1∑n​(xi​−yi​)2​
    
    Then $(\mathbb{R}^n, d)$ is a metric space (requires Cauchy–Schwarz to verify triangle inequality).  
    _Note_: Square root is used but not yet formally defined.
    
4. On $\mathbb{C}$, define $d(z_1, z_2) = |z_1 - z_2|$. Then $(\mathbb{C}, d)$ is a metric space.
    
5. Let $Y \subseteq X$ and $d_Y = d|_{Y \times Y}$. Then $(Y, d_Y)$ is a **subspace** of $(X, d)$.
    

---

### Density in Metric Spaces

Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space and $A \subseteq X$. Then $A$ is **dense in $X$** if:

For all $x \in X$ and $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $a \in A$ such that $d(a, x) < \varepsilon$

> Intuitively: points of $A$ come arbitrarily close to every point in $X$.

**Exercise**: Prove that both $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}$ are dense in $\mathbb{R}$.

---

### Length of Intervals

We define the **length** of an interval (or half-open/closed variant) $[a, b]$ as:

ℓ([a,b])=b−a\ell([a, b]) = b - aℓ([a,b])=b−a

---

## Definition 7: Vector Space over a Field

Let $\mathbb{F}$ be a field (e.g., $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{Q}$, or $\mathbb{C}$), and let $V$ be a set with operations:

- **Addition**: $+: V \times V \to V$
    
- **Scalar multiplication**: $\cdot : \mathbb{F} \times V \to V$
    

Then $(\mathbb{F}, V, +, \cdot)$ is a **vector space** over $\mathbb{F}$ if the following axioms hold for all $u, v, w \in V$ and $a, b \in \mathbb{F}$:

1. $u + (v + w) = (u + v) + w$
    
2. $u + v = v + u$
    
3. There exists $0 \in V$ such that $v + 0 = v$
    
4. For every $v$, there exists $-v$ such that $v + (-v) = 0$
    
5. $a(bv) = (ab)v$
    
6. $a(v + w) = av + aw$
    
7. $(a + b)v = av + bv$
    
8. $1 \cdot v = v$
    

> $(V, +, \cdot)$ is then called an $\mathbb{F}$-vector space

### Exercise

Construct operations $+$ and scalar multiplication $\cdot$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ making it into an $\mathbb{R}$-vector space.
