Let $A \subset \mathbb{R}$.

- If $\forall a \in A$, $a \leq M$, then $M$ is an upper bound of $A$.
    
- If $\forall a \in A$, $a \geq m$, then $m$ is a lower bound of $A$.
    
- $A$ is bounded if it has both upper and lower bounds.
    
- Boundedness $\iff$ $\exists B > 0$ such that $\forall a \in A$, $|a| \leq B$.
